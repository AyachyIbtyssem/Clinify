# Clinify
The project involves developing a web and mobile platform to digitize clinic services, including patient, doctor, and consultation management. Patients will receive notifications for appointments, medication reminders, and personalized health tips. Using microservices, Angular, Node.js, and MySQL, it aims to enhance service quality.
